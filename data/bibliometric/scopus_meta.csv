A recent study showed that female guppies are twice as efficient as males in a reversal learning task involving yellow–red discrimination, suggesting a higher cognitive flexibility in female guppies. However, the possibility exists that the superior performance exhibited by females does not reflect a general sex difference in cognitive abilities, but instead, is confined to colour discrimination tasks. To address this issue, we compared male and female guppies in two different discrimination reversal learning tasks and we performed a meta-analysis of these experiments and the previous one involving colour discrimination. In the first experiment of this study, guppies were tested in a task requiring them to learn to select the correct arm of a T-maze in order to rejoin a group of conspecifics. In experiment 2, guppies were observed in a numerical task requiring them to discriminate between 5 and 10 dots in order to obtain a food reward. Although females outperformed males in one condition of the T-maze, we did not find any clear evidence of females’ greater reversal learning performance in either experiment. However, the meta-analysis of the three experiments supported the hypothesis of females’ greater reversal learning ability. Our data do not completely exclude the idea that female guppies have a generally higher cognitive flexibility than males; however, they suggest that the size of this sex difference might depend on the task. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Fish cognition; Numerical abilities; Poecilia reticulata; Reversal learning; Sex differences; T-maze","Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cognition; Discrimination Learning; Female; Male; Poecilia; Reversal Learning; Sex Characteristics; animal; animal behavior; cognition; discrimination learning; female; male; meta analysis; physiology; Poecilia; reversal learning; sexual characteristics","Agrillo C., Bisazza A., Spontaneous versus trained numerical abilities.

Using 457 effect sizes, we show that, while both rats and mice are capable of emotional contagion, there are differences in how various factors modulate empathy in these species: 1) only mice show strain-specific differences in emotional contagion response; 2) although rats and mice have equivalent contagion response to familiar and unfamiliar individuals, our results show that familiarity length is negatively correlated with level of contagion in rats only; 3) prior experience with emotional stimuli almost doubles fear contagion response in rats while no changes are detected in pre-exposed mice; 4) both mice and rats tested alone show comparable reduced contagion compared to animals tested in a group; 5) emotional contagion is reduced in animals from both species missing one sensory modality compared to situations where all sensory modalities are recruited during emotional contagion. Lastly, we report similar patterns of brain activation during emotional contagion in rats and mice. © 2020 The Author(s)","Emotional contagion; Empathy; Meta-analysis; Rodents","Animals; Brain; Emotions; Empathy; Mice; Rats; Recognition, Psychology; Rodentia; adult; brain; controlled study; effect size; empathy; fear; human; human experiment; male; meta analysis; mouse; nonhuman; rat; review; rodent; theoretical study; animal; emotion; empathy; physiology","Allsop S.A., Wichmann R., Mills F., Ba D., Brown E.N., Tye K.M., Allsop S.A., Wichmann R., Mills F., Burgos-robles A., Et al., Corticoamygdala transfer of socially derived information gates observational learning article corticoamygdala transfer of socially derived information gates observational learning, Cell, pp. 1-14, (2018); Anderson E.E., The effect of the presence of a second animal upon emotional behavior in the male albino rat, J.

Establishing causality has been challenging in existing human studies, due to confounding by genetic and postnatal environment. Animal experiments can improve our understanding of this association. This systematic review examined the effects of maternal obesity in pregnancy on offspring neurobehavior in animal models. We included 26 studies (1047 offspring animals). Meta-analyses showed that offspring of obese mothers displayed higher levels of locomotor activity (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.34 [0.10; 0.58]) and anxiety behavior (SMD 0.47 [0.16; 0.79]) than offspring of lean mothers, but similar memory abilities (SMD −0.06 [−0.52; 0.39]). Meta-analysis of learning abilities was not sensible due to heterogeneity. Although the evidence was heterogeneous and the quality of the included studies generally unclear, this systematic review of animal studies indicates an effect of maternal obesity on increased offspring locomotor activity and anxiety, but not on offspring memory performance. These findings may be important from a public health perspective since obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide, and warrant further research. © 2018","Animal experiments; Neurobehavior; Obesity; Offspring; Pregnancy; Systematic review","Animal Experimentation; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Child of Impaired Parents; Female; Humans; Motor Activity; Obesity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; anxiety; behavior; human; learning; locomotion; maternal obesity; memory; nonhuman; priority journal; progeny; publication bias; Review; systematic review; animal; animal behavior; animal experiment; child of impaired parents; complication; female; motor activity; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication","Aburasayn H., Al Batran R., Gopal K., Almutairi M., Eshreif A., Eaton F., Et al., Female offspring born to obese and insulin-resistant dams are not at increased risk for obesity and metabolic dysfunction during early development, Can.

Symptoms induced by maternal separation that mirror clinically relevant aspects of mental problems, such as cognitive inflexibility, open the possibility of testing putative therapeutics prior to clinical development. Although several animal (e.g., rodent) studies have evaluated the effects of early maternal separation on cognitive flexibility, no consistent conclusions have been drawn. To clarify this issue, in this study, a meta-analysis method was used to systematically explore the relationship between early maternal separation and cognitive flexibility in rodent offspring. Results indicate that early maternal separation could significantly impair cognitive flexibility in rodent offspring. Moderator analyses further showed that the relationship between early maternal separation and cognitive flexibility was not consistent in any case, but was moderated by variations in the experimental procedures, such as the deprivation levels, task characteristics, and rodent strains. These clarify the inconsistent effects of maternal separation on cognitive flexibility in rodents and help us better understand the association between early life adversity and cognitive development. © 2022","Cognitive flexibility; Maternal separation; Meta-analysis; Rodents; Strain; Task characteristics","Animals; Cognition; Maternal Deprivation; Rodentia; article; cognitive development; cognitive flexibility; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; maternal deprivation; meta analysis; nonhuman; progeny; rodent; animal; cognition","Alberts J.R., Huddling by rat pups: ontogeny of individual and group behavior, Dev.

There have been many studies conducted across multiple different species regarding coordinating abilities. These studies aim to provide data which will help illuminate the evolutionary origins of cooperative problem solving and coordination. However, it is impossible to make firm conclusions about the evolutionary origins of coordinating abilities without a thorough comparative analysis of the existing data. Furthermore, there may be certain aspects of the literature that make it very difficult to confidently address evolutionary and meta-analytic questions. This study aimed to rectify this by using meta-analysis, phylogenetic analysis and systematic review to analyse the data already obtained across multiple studies, and to assess the reliability of this data. We found that many studies did not provide the information necessary for meta-analysis, or were not comparable enough to other studies to be included in analyses, meaning meta-analyses were underpowered or could not be conducted due to low samples of both studies and different species. Overall, we found that many studies reported small positive effects across studies, but the standard errors of these effects frequently traversed zero. © 2022 The Authors.","cognition; cooperation; coordination; meta-analysis; problem-solving","","Farrar BG, Altschul DM, Fischer J, van der Mescht J, Placi S, Troisi CA, Vernouillet A, Clayton NS, Ostojic L., Trialling meta-research in comparative cognition: claims and statistical inference in animal physical cognition, Anim.

In humans, face recognition is characterized by certain cognitive specializations such as face-specific sensitivity to upright faces. The face inversion effect reflects the disproportionate inversion cost (i.e., poorer recognition of inverted compared to upright stimuli) for faces compared to non-face objects. Numerous studies have evaluated the face inversion effect in various nonhuman primates, but the findings are highly variable and mixed, especially in monkeys. To address this inconsistency, the current study employed a multilevel, phylogenetic meta-analysis on 52 effect sizes across 16 studies to quantify the magnitude of the face inversion effect in nonhuman primates. Overall, the difference in inversion costs for faces compared to nonface stimuli was small but not statistically significant (b = 0.31, se = 0.16, 95% CI [− 0.01, 0.62], p = 0.06). Additionally, this did not systematically vary between the family of species (chimpanzee or monkey) or type of face stimuli (conspecific or heterospecific). Ultimately, it cannot be concluded that the face inversion effect is a reliable phenomenon in either chimpanzees or monkeys, suggesting that nonhuman primates may not use similar face-specific processing strategies as humans. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chimpanzee;

Prior studies suggest that this is accompanied by an increase in the hedonic value of the CS, although the reliability of this effect is yet to be fully established. Here, flavour CS+s were mixed with either 16% sucrose or maltodextrin (with control CS-s mixed with 2% solutions of the same carbohydrate). While a reliable preference for the CS+ was seen in every case, and there was a learned increase in lick cluster size when all conditions were considered together, this difference was significant in only one experimental condition considered alone. A meta-analysis of these results and similar published licking microstructure analysis studies found that the Cohen’s dav effect size for changes in licking microstructure after flavour preference learning was 0.16. This is far smaller than the effect sizes reported when assessing learned hedonic changes in flavour preference based on other test or training methods.

In DMTS, a sample stimulus is first presented and then removed. After a delay, two (or more) comparison stimuli are presented, and the subject is rewarded for choosing the one matching the sample. We used data on performance vs. delay length to estimate two parameters informative of working memory abilities: the maximum performance possible with no delay (comparison stimuli presented as soon as the sample is removed), and the rate of performance decay as the delay is lengthened (related to memory span). We conclude that there is little evidence that zero-delay performance varies between these species. There is evidence that pigeons do not perform as well as mammals at longer delay intervals. Pigeons, however, are the only extensively studied bird, and we cannot exclude that other birds may be able to bridge as long a delay as mammals. Extensive training may improve memory, although the data are open to other interpretations. Overall, DMTS studies suggest memory spans ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. We suggest that observations of animals exhibiting much longer memory spans (days to months) can be explained in terms of specialized memory systems that deal with specific, biologically significant information, such as food caches. Events that do not trigger these systems, on the other hand, appear to be remembered for only a short time.

However, these results have not been synthesized in a quantitative way. Here, we systematically search the literature and conduct a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of empirical papers that have tested the relationship between animal personality (exploration, boldness, activity, aggression and sociability) and cognition (initial learning/reversal speed, number of correct choices/errors after standard training). We find evidence for a small but significant relationship between variation in personality and variation in learning across species in the absolute scale; however, the direction of this relationship is highly variable and when both positive and negative effect sizes are considered, the average effect size does not differ significantly from zero. Importantly, this variation among studies is not explained by differences in personality or learning measure, or taxonomic grouping. Further, these results do not support current hypotheses suggesting that that fast-explorers are fast-learners or that slow-explorers perform better on tests of reversal learning. Rather, we find evidence that bold animals are faster learners, but only when boldness is measured in response to a predator (or simulated predator) and not when boldness is measured by exposure to a novel object (or novel food). Further, although only a small sub-sample of papers reported results separately for males and females, sex explained a significant amount of variation in effect size. These results, therefore, suggest that, while personality and learning are indeed related across a range of species, the direction of this relationship is highly variable. Thus further empirical work is needed to determine whether there are important moderators of this relationship.

Studies often focus on a subset of high-performing subjects, sometimes viewing evidence from a single individual as sufficient to demonstrate the cognitive capacity of a species. We argue that the emphasis on demonstrating species-level cognitive capacities detracts from the value of individual variation in understanding cognitive development and evolution. We consider developmental and evolutionary interpretations of individual variation and use metaanalyses of data from published studies to examine predictors of individual performance. We show that reliance on small sample sizes precludes robust conclusions about individual abilities as well as inter- and intraspecific differences. We advocate standardization of experimental protocols and pooling of data between laboratories to improve statistical rigour. Our analyses show that cognitive performance is influenced by age, sex, rearing conditions and previous experience. These effects limit the validity of comparative analyses unless developmental histories are taken into account, and complicate attempts to understand how cognitive traits are expressed and selected under natural conditions. Further understanding of cognitive evolution requires efforts to elucidate the heritability of cognitive traits and establish whether elevated cognitive performance confers fitness advantages in nature. © 2012 The Royal Society.","Cognition; Development; Evolution; Individual differences; Meta-analysis; Reproductive fitness","age class; biological development; cognition; data set; evolutionary biology; fitness; individual variation; life history trait; meta-analysis","Darwin C., On the Origin of the Species By Means of Natural Selection, (1859); Skinner B.F., The Behavior of Organisms, (1938); Tinbergen N., The Study of Instinct, (1951); Piaget J., The Origins of Intelligence In Children, (1974); Baars B.J., The Cognitive Revolution In Psychology, (1986); Shettleworth S.J., Cognition, Evolution and Behaviour, (2010); Clutton-Brock T., Sheldon B.C., The seven ages of Pan, Science, 327, pp. 1207-1208, (2010); Dall S.R.X., Houston A.I., McNamara J.M., The behavioural ecology of personality: Consistent individual differences from an adaptive perspective, Ecol Lett, 7, pp. 734-739, (2004); Sih A., Del Giudice M., Linking behavioural syndromes and cognition: A behavioural ecology perspective, Phil.

Over the past several years, five articles (over 32 experiments) have examined the ability of corvids (e.g., rooks, crows, and jays) to complete lab-based analogs of this fable, by requiring them to drop stones and other objects into tubes of water to retrieve a floating worm (Bird and Emery in Curr Biol 19:1–5, 2009b; Cheke et al. in Anim Cogn 14:441–455, 2011; Jelbert et al. in PLoS One 3:e92895, 2014; Logan et al. in PLoS One 7:e103049, 2014; Taylor et al. in Gray R D 12:e26887, 2011). These researchers have stressed the unique potential of this paradigm for understanding causal reasoning in corvids. Ghirlanda and Lind (Anim Behav 123:239–247, 2017) re-evaluated trial-level data from these studies and concluded that initial preferences for functional objects, combined with trial-and-error learning, may account for subjects’ performance on key variants of the paradigm. In the present paper, we use meta-analytic techniques to provide more precise information about the rate and mode of learning that occurs within and across tasks. Within tasks, subjects learned from successful (but not unsuccessful) actions, indicating that higher-order reasoning about phenomena such as mass, volume, and displacement is unlikely to be involved. Furthermore, subjects did not transfer information learned in one task to subsequent tasks, suggesting that corvids do not engage with these tasks as variants of the same problem (i.e., how to generate water displacement to retrieve a floating worm). Our methodological analysis and empirical findings raise the question: Can Aesop’s fable studies distinguish between trial-and-error learning and/or higher-order causal reasoning? We conclude they cannot. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aesop’s fable; Causal reasoning; Causal understanding; Comparative cognition; Corvid; New Caledonian crows; Object bias; Perceptual-motor feedback","Animals; Cognition; Crows; Learning; Problem Solving; Tool Use Behavior; animal; cognition; Corvus; learning; meta analysis; physiology; problem solving; tool use","Bates D., Maechler M., Bolker B., Walker S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, J Stat Softw, 67, pp. 1-48, (2015); Bird C.D., Emery N.J., Insightful problem solving and creative tool modification by captive nontool-using rooks, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 106, (2009); Bird C.D., Emery N.J., Rooks use stones to raise the water level to reach a floating worm, Curr Biol, 19, pp. 1-5, (2009); Cheke L.G., Bird C.D., Clayton N.S., Tool-use and instrumental learning in the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), Anim Cogn, 14, pp. 441-455, (2011); Cheng P., From covariation to causation: a causal power theory, Psychol Rev, 104, pp. 367-405, (1997); Domjan M., Biological constraints on instrumental and classical conditioning: Implications for general process theory, Psychol Learn Motivat, 17, pp. 215-277, (1983); Dunlap A.S., Stephens D.W., Experimental evolution of prepared learning, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 111, (2014); Garcia J., Koelling R.A., Relation of cue to consequence in avoidance learning, Psychonom Sci, 4, pp. 123-124, (1966); Ghirlanda S., Lind J., ‘Aesop’s fable’ experiments demonstrate trial-and-error leaning in birds, but no causal understanding, Anim Behav, 123, pp. 239-247, (2017); Hunt G.R., Vice-anvil use in nut processing by two Corvus species, N Z Journal of Zool, 41, 1, pp. 68-76, (2014); Jelbert S.A., Taylor A.H., Cheke L.G., Clayton N.S., Gray R.D., Using the Aesop’s Fable paradigm to investigate causal understanding of water displacement by New Caledonian crows, PLoS One, 3, (2014); Jelbert S.A., Taylor A.H., Gray R.D., Investigating animal cognition with the Aesop’s Fable paradigm: Current understanding and future directions, Communicat Integr Biol, 8, (2015); Logan C.J., Behavioral flexibility and problem solving in an invasive bird, Peer J, 4, (2016); Logan C.J., Jelbert S.A., Breen A.J., Gray R.D., Taylor A.H., Modifications to the Aesop’s Fable paradigm change New Caledonian crow performances, PLoS One, 7, (2014); Logan C.J., Harvey B.D., Schlinger B.A., Rensel M., Western scrub-jays do not appear to attend to functionality in Aesop’s Fable experiments, Peer J, 4, (2015); Penn D.C., Povinelli D.J., On the lack of evidence that chimpanzees possess anything remotely resembling a ‘theory of mind’, Philosophical Trans R Soc B, 362, pp. 731-744, (2007); Penn D.C., Holyoak K.J., Povinelli D.J., Darwin’s mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds, Behav Brain Sci, 31, pp. 109-178, (2008); Povinelli D.J., World without weight: Perspectives on an alien mind, (2011); Raudenbush S.W., Bryk A.S., Hierarchical linear models: applications and data analysis methods, 1, (2002); Rutz C., Sugasawa S., van der Wal J.E.M., Klump B.C., St. Clair J.J.H., Tool bending in New Caledonian crows, R Soc Open Sci, (2016); Shettleworth S.J., Cognition, evolution and behavior, (1998); Shettleworth S.J., The evolution of comparative cognition: is the snark still a boojum?, Behav Process, 80, (2009); Shettleworth S.J., Modularity, comparative cognition, and human uniqueness, Philos Trans R Soc B, 367, pp. 2794-2802, (2012); Taylor A.H., Corvid cognition, Cognit Sci, 5, pp. 361-372, (2014); Taylor A.H., Gray R.D., Animal cognition: Aesop’s Fable flies from fiction to fact, Curr Biol, 19, pp. R713-R732, (2009); Taylor A.H., Elliffe D.M., Hunt G.R., Emery N.J., Clayton N.S., Gray R.D., New Caledonian crows learn the functional properties of novel tool types, PLoS ONE, 12, (2011); Timberlake W., Behavior systems and reinforcement: an integrative approach, J Exp Anal Behav, 60, pp. 105-128, (1993); Tolman E.C., Purposive behavior in animals and men, (1932); Weir A.A.S., Chappell J., Kacelnik A., Shaping of hooks in New Caledonian crows, Science, 297, (2002); Wickham H., Chang W., An Implementation of the Grammar of Graphics, (2015)","L.

While early reviews have proved useful in providing an overview of the field, they have not been accompanied by quantitative analysis to systematically evaluate the contribution of biological and methodological moderators on the proportion of illusory choice. In the current meta-analytical study, we confirm that geometrical visual illusion perception is a general phenomenon among non-human animals. Additionally, we found that studies testing birds report stronger illusion perception compared to other classes, as do those on animals with lateral-positioned eyes compared to animals with forward-facing eyes. In terms of methodological choices, we found a positive correlation between the number of trials during training or testing and the effect sizes, while studies with larger samples report smaller effect sizes. Despite studies that trained animals with artificial stimuli showing larger effect sizes compared with those using spontaneous testing with naturalistic stimuli, like food, we found more recent studies prefer spontaneous choice over training. We discuss the challenges and bottlenecks in this area of study, which, if addressed, could lead to more successful advances in the future. © 2024 The Authors.","geometrical visual illusion; individual differences; motivation; perception; spontaneous testing; training","Animals; Birds; Illusions; Optical Illusions; Visual Perception; meta-analysis; perception; testing method; training; animal; bird; illusion; meta analysis; physiology; vision; visual illusion","Gregory R.L., Visual illusions classified, Trends Cogn.

Morand-Ferron J., Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada","Behavioural and cognitive processes play important roles in mediating an individual’s interactions with its environment. Yet, while there is a vast literature on repeatable individual differences in behaviour, relatively little is known about the repeatability of cognitive performance. To further our understanding of the evolution of cognition, we gathered 44 studies on individual performance of 25 species across six animal classes and used metaanalysis to assess whether cognitive performance is repeatable. We compared repeatability (R) in performance (1) on the same task presented at different times (temporal repeatability), and (2) on different tasks that measured the same putative cognitive ability (contextual repeatability). We also addressed whether R estimates were influenced by seven extrinsic factors (moderators): type of cognitive performance measurement, type of cognitive task, delay between tests, origin of the subjects, experimental context, taxonomic class and publication status. We found support for both temporal and contextual repeatability of cognitive performance, with mean R estimates ranging between 0.15 and 0.28. Repeatability estimates were mostly influenced by the type of cognitive performance measures and publication status. Our findings highlight the widespread occurrence of consistent inter-individual variation in cognition across a range of taxa which, like behaviour, may be associated with fitness outcomes.

However, innovation is also crucial for other animals, by allowing them to cope with novel socioecological challenges. Although innovation plays such a central role in animals’ lives, we still do not know the conditions required for innovative behaviour to emerge. Here, we focused on interindividual differences in innovation by (1) extensively reviewing existing literature on innovative behaviour in animals and (2) quantitatively testing the different evolutionary hypotheses that have been proposed to explain interindividual variation in innovation propensity during foraging tasks. We ran a series of phylogenetically controlled mixed-effects meta-regression models to determine which hypotheses (if any) are supported by currently available empirical studies. Our analyses show that innovation is more common in individuals that are older and belong to the larger sex, but also in more neophilic and/or explorative individuals. Moreover, these effects change depending on the study setting (i.e. wild versus captive). Our results provide no clear support to the excess of energy or the bad competitor hypotheses and suggest that study setting and interindividual differences in traits related to personality are also important predictors of innovation. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","age; bad competitor hypothesis; excess of energy hypothesis; innovation; interindividual differences; intraspecific variation; personality; rank; sex","Animalia; age structure; empirical analysis; evolutionary biology; human behavior; human evolution; hypothesis testing; individual variation; innovation; intraspecific variation; meta-analysis","Amici F., Call J., Aureli F., Aversion to violation of expectations of food distribution: The role of social tolerance and relative dominance in seven primate species, Behaviour, 149, pp. 345-368, (2012); Aplin L., Bringing avian cognition to the wild, Field and laboratory methods in animal cognition, pp. 92-94, (2018); Arnold C., Matthews L.J., Nunn C.L., The 10kTrees website: A new online resource for primate phylogeny, Evolutionary Anthropology, 19, pp. 114-118, (2010); Auersperg A.M.I., von Bayern A.M.P., Gajdon G.K., Huber L., Kacelnik A., Flexibility in problem solving and tool use of kea and New Caledonian crows in a multi access box paradigm, PLoS One, 6, 6, (2011); Bastian M.L., van Noordwijk M.A., van Schaik C.P., Innovative behaviors in wild Bornean orangutans revealed by targeted population comparison, Behaviour, 149, pp. 275-297, (2012); Benson-Amram S., Dantzer B., Stricker G., Swanson E.M., Holekamp K.E., Brain size predicts problem-solving ability in mammalian carnivores, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113, pp. 2532-2537, (2016); Benson-Amram S., Holekamp K.E., Innovative problem solving by wild spotted hyenas, Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 279, pp. 4087-4095, (2012); Benson-Amram S., Weldele M.L., Holekamp K.E., A comparison of innovative problem-solving abilities between wild and captive spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, Animal Behaviour, 85, pp. 349-356, (2013); Berger J., Swenson J.E., Persson I.L., Recolonizing carnivores and naïve prey: Conservation lessons from pleistocene extinctions, Science, 291, pp. 1036-1039, (2001); Bergman T.J., Kitchen D.M., Comparing responses to novel objects in wild baboons (Papio ursinus) and geladas (Theropithecus gelada), Animal Cognition, 12, pp. 63-73, (2009); Biro D., Inoue-Nakamura N., Tonooka R., Yamakoshi G., Sousa C., Matsuzawa T., Cultural innovation and transmission of tool use in wild chimpanzees: Evidence from field experiments, Animal Cognition, 6, pp. 213-223, (2003); Boesch C., What makes us human (Homo sapiens)?

An important question concerns whether it is the principal source of differences in cognitive abilities between species, as is the case with comparisons involving many human populations. Using meta-analytic databases of ethological observations of cognitive abilities involving 69 primate species, we found that cognitive abilities that load more strongly on a common factor (which is here termed G, in line with the terminology developed in previous literature to describe aggregated measures of general intelligence) are associated with significantly bigger interspecies differences and bigger interspecies variance. Additionally, two novel evolutionary predictions were made: more G-loaded abilities would present (1) weaker phylogenetic signals, indicating less phylogenetic conservativeness, and (2) faster rates of trait evolution, as it was hypothesized that G has been subjected to stronger selection pressures than narrower, more domain-specific abilities. These predictions were corroborated with phylogenetic comparative methods, with stronger effects among catarrhines (apes and Old World monkeys) than within the entire primate order. These data strongly suggest that G is the principal locus of selection in the macroevolution of primate intelligence. Implications for the understanding of population differences in cognitive abilities among human populations and for the theory of massive modularity applied to intelligence are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","General intelligence; Macroevolution; Phylogenetic comparative methods; Primates; Spearman's hypothesis","","Ackerly D., Conservatism and diversification of plant functional traits: Evolutionary rates versus phylogenetic signal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, pp. 19699-19706, (2009); Adams D.C., Comparing evolutionary rates for different phenotypic traits on a phylogeny using likelihood, Systematic Biology, 62, pp. 181-192, (2013); Allen C., Bekoff M., Species of mind: The philosophy and biology of cognitive ethology, (1997); Amici F., Barney B., Johnson V.E., Call J., Aureli F., A modular mind?

The present meta-analysis of radial maze and water maze experiments was conducted to assess the reliablility and magnitude of sex effects in the standard rodent models of learning and memory. Data were culled from published and unpublished sources. Findings indicate large reliable male advantages for rats in radial maze and water maze protocols. Significant strain differences were also identified. In each paradigm, protocol variations were associated with differential sex effects. For the water maze, smaller male advantages were associated with pretraining regimens and for the radial maze, larger significant male advantages were observed in protocols that included unbaited arms (combined reference and working memory protocols). Mouse studies exhibited a different pattern of sex effects; small female advantages were evident in the water maze, but small male advantages were evident in the radial maze. Together these findings establish the reliability of male advantages in spatial working and reference memory for rats across strains, protocols, ages and rearing environments. The findings also support an important species dichotomy between rats and mice that should be considered when transitioning from rat to mouse models. In light of these results, the biological evidence supporting theoretical explanations of sex differences is reviewed and evalualted. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, studies testing music effects on memory had found different improvements, which could be due to the methodological differences across studies. Thus, the purpose of this article was to systematically review the literature and meta-analyze the effects of music on Rattus norvegicus’ explicit memory (Maze tests) only in controlled investigations. The seven studies included led to a very homogeneous analysis (I 2 = 0%), confirming the consistency of the significant standardized mean difference (SMD) between the memory of animals exposed and not exposed to music (SMD 0.60 (95% CI 0.38; 0.83, p < 0.001)). Exploratory analysis suggests music benefits on memory can be acquired when begun at any age, when tested with the three types of mazes evaluated, with exposure lasting from 8 to 83 days and when the age on test day was either under 30 days or over 30 days. To expand the actual understanding of music effects on memory, future studies should investigate different types of music and animal species, with different sex and health conditions, at different time points. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Marta Olivetti Belardinelli.","Classical music;

Whereas most human studies are limited to correlational conclusions, rodent studies can prospectively investigate how ELA alters cognitive performance in several domains. Despite the volume of reports, there is no consensus on i) the behavioral domains being affected by ELA and ii) the extent of these effects. To test how ELA (here: aberrant maternal care) affects specific behavioral domains, we used a 3-level mixed-effect meta-analysis, and thoroughly explored heterogeneity with MetaForest, a novel machine-learning approach. Our results are based on >400 independent experiments, involving ∼8600 animals. Especially in males, ELA promotes memory formation during stressful learning but impairs non-stressful learning. Furthermore, ELA increases anxiety-like and decreases social behavior. The ELA phenotype was strongest when i) combined with other negative experiences (“hits”); ii) in rats; iii) in ELA models of ∼10days duration. All data is easily accessible with MaBapp (https://osf.io/ra947/), allowing researchers to run tailor-made meta-analyses, thereby revealing the optimal choice of experimental protocols and study power. © 2019","Anxiety-like behavior; Behavior; Early life adversity; Early life stress; MaBapp; Maternal care; Maternal separation; Memory; Meta-analysis; Metaforest; Rodent; Social behavior","Adverse Childhood Experiences; Animals; Anxiety; Behavior, Animal; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Male; Memory; Phenotype; Rodentia; Social Behavior; Stress, Psychological; anxiety; cognitive defect; early life adversity; experimental design; experimental study; human; life stress; machine learning; memory; mental disease; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; social behavior; animal; animal behavior; disease model; female; male; mental stress; meta analysis; pathophysiology; phenotype; physiology; rodent; social behavior","Aarts E., Verhage M., Veenvliet J.V., Dolan C.V., van der Sluis S., A solution to dependency: using multilevel analysis to accommodate nested data, Nat.

Inclusion criteria included: a) appetitive conditioning paradigm; b) measure of conditioning; c) sleep measurement and/or sleep loss; d) human and/etor non-human animal samples; and e) written in English. Searches of seven databases returned 3777 publications. The final sample consisted of 42 studies using primarily animal samples and involving food- and drug-related conditioning tasks. We found sleep loss disrupted appetitive conditioning of food rewards (p < 0.001) but potentiated appetitive conditioning of drug rewards (p < 0.001). Furthermore, sleep loss negatively impacted extinction learning irrespective of the reward type. Post-learning sleep was associated with increases in REM sleep (p = 0.02). Findings suggest sleep loss potentiates the impact of psychoactive substances in a manner likely to produce an increased risk of problematic substance use. In obese/overweight populations, sleep loss may be associated with deficits in the conditioning and extinction of reward-related behaviours. Further research should assess the relationship between sleep and appetitive conditioning in humans. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Addiction; Appetitive conditioning; Associative learning; Eating disorders; Learning; Reinforcement; Sleep; Sleep deprivation; Sleep loss; Sleep restriction; Substance use","Animals; Appetitive Behavior; Conditioning, Classical; Humans; Learning; Obesity; Overweight; Reward; Sleep; appetitive conditioning; conditioning; effect size; human; learning; memory consolidation; nonhuman; obesity; peer review; population research; psychological extinction; quantitative analysis; REM sleep; Review; reward; risk assessment; risk factor; sample size; sleep; sleep debt; slow wave sleep; substance use; systematic review; working memory; animal; appetitive behavior; conditioned reflex; learning; meta analysis; sleep","Alhola P., Polo-Kantola P., Sleep deprivation: impact on cognitive performance, Neuropsychiatr.

We searched PubMed and Web of Science for publications that assessed the effects of handling, maternal separation (MS), and limited bedding and nesting (LBN) on performance in the Morris water maze (MWM), novel object recognition (NOR), and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria (n = 451–763 rodents per test) and were used to calculate standardized mean differences (Hedge’s g) and to assess heterogeneity, publication bias, and the moderating effects of sex and species (rats vs. mice). We found significantly lower heterogeneity in LBN compared to handling and MS with no consistent effects of sex or species across the three paradigms. LBN and MS caused similar cognitive deficits in tasks that rely heavily on the dorsal hippocampus, such as MWM and NOR, and were significantly different compared to the improved performance seen in rodents exposed to handling. In the CFC task, which relies more on the ventral hippocampus, all three paradigms showed reduced freezing with moderate effect sizes that were not statistically different. These findings demonstrate the utility of using meta-analysis to quantify outcomes in a large number of inconsistent preclinical studies and highlight the need to further investigate the possibility that handling causes different alterations in the dorsal hippocampus but similar outcomes in the ventral hippocampus when compared to MS and LBN. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Adverse Childhood Experiences; Animals; Hippocampus; Maternal Deprivation; Memory; Mice; Rats; Rodentia; Article; cognitive defect; contextual fear conditioning; dorsal hippocampus; early life stress; fear conditioning test; freezing; hippocampus; limited bedding and nesting; maternal deprivation; memory; meta analysis; Morris water maze test; mouse; nesting; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; rat; systematic review; task performance; ventral hippocampus; animal; hippocampus; maternal deprivation; memory; rodent","Teicher M.H., Samson J.A., Annual research review: enduring neurobiological effects of childhood abuse and neglect, J.

Conducting extinction in multiple contexts has been explored as a technique to decrease the recovery of extinguished responses. The present meta-analysis aimed to examine whether extinction in multiple contexts can consistently reduce the recovery of extinguished responses. After searching in several databases, experiments were included in the analysis if they presented extinction in multiple contexts, an experimental design, and an adequate statistical report. Cohen’s d was obtained for each critical comparison and weighted to obtain the sample’s average weighted effect size. Analyses were then performed using a multilevel meta-analytic approach. Twenty-five studies were included, with a total sample of 37 experiments or critical comparisons. The analyses showed a large effect size for the sample, moderated by the length of conditioned stimulus exposure, type of experimental subject, and type of recovery. The robust effect of extinction in multiple contexts on relapse should encourage clinicians to consider extinction in multiple contexts as a useful technique in therapy and research. © The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2023.","Exposure therapy;

In European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a previous study found that birds that were lighter for their skeletal size, and birds that had undergone greater shortening of erythrocyte telomeres over the course of development, were more impulsive as adults. Here, we studied the impulsivity of a separate cohort of 29 starlings hand-reared under different combinations of food amount and begging effort. The task involved repeated choice between a key yielding one pellet after 3 s and another key yielding two pellets after 8 s. Impulsivity was operationalised as the proportion of choices for the short-delay option. We found striking variation in impulsivity. We did not replicate the results of the previous study concerning developmental telomere attrition, though combining all the evidence to date in a meta-analysis did support that robustness of that association. We also found that early-life conditions and mass for skeletal size interacted in predicting impulsivity. Specifically, birds that had experienced the combination of high begging effort and low food amount were less impulsive than other groups, and the usual negative relationship between impulsivity and body mass was abolished in birds that had experienced high begging effort. We discuss methodological differences between our study and studies that measure impulsivity using an adjusting-delay procedure. © 2019, The Author(s).","Avian cognition; Energetic state; Impulsivity; Starlings; Sturnus vulgaris; Telomeres","Animals; Impulsive Behavior; Reward; Starlings; animal; impulsiveness; meta analysis; reward; starling","Allen C., Nettle D., Hunger and socioeconomic impulsivity in humans background additively predict impulsivity in humans, Curr Psychol, (2019); Andrews C., Nettle D., Reichert S., Et al., A marker of biological ageing predicts adult risk preference in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, Behav Ecol, (2018); Bateson M., Recent advances in our understanding of risk-sensitive foraging preferences, Proc Nutr Soc, 61, pp. 509-516, (2002); Bateson M., Kacelnik A., Preferences for fixed and variable food sources: variability in amount and delay, J Exp Anal Behav, 63, pp. 313-329, (1995); Bateson M., Kacelnik A., Rate currencies and the foraging starling: the fallacy of the averages revisited, Behav Ecol, 7, pp. 341-352, (1996); Bateson M., Brilot B.O., Gillespie R., Et al., Developmental telomere attrition predicts impulsive decision-making in adult starlings, Proc R Soc B Biol Sci, 282, (2015); Boonekamp J.J., Mulder G.A., Salomons H.M., Et al., Nestling telomere shortening, but not telomere length, reflects developmental stress and predicts survival in wild birds, Proc R Soc B Biol Sci, 281, (2014); Brydges N.M., Holmes M.C., Harris A.P., Et al., Early life stress produces compulsive-like, but not impulsive, behavior in females, Behav Neurosci, 129, pp. 300-308, (2015); Cardinal R.N., Aitken M.R.F., Whisker: a client-server high-performance multimedia research control system, Behav Res Methods, 42, pp. 1059-1071, (2010); Craig A.R., Maxfield A.D., Stein J.S., Et al., Do the adjusting-delay and increasing-delay tasks measure the same construct, Delay discounting?

Driven by the absence of conclusive evidence on this topic and the Research Domain Criteria framework, random-effects meta-analyses were adopted to quantify the effects of acute stressors on reward responsiveness, valuation, and learning in rodent and human subjects. In rodents, acute stress reduced reward responsiveness (g = −1.43) and valuation (g = −0.32), while amplifying reward learning (g = 1.17). In humans, acute stress had marginal effects on valuation (g = 0.25), without affecting responsiveness and learning. Moderation analyses suggest that acute stress neither has unitary effects on reward processing in rodents nor in humans and that the duration of the stressor and specificity of reward experience (i.e., food vs drugs) may produce qualitatively and quantitatively different behavioral endpoints. Subgroup analyses failed to reduce heterogeneity, which, together with the presence of publication bias, pose caution on the conclusions that can be drawn and point to the need of guidelines for the conduction of future studies in the field. © 2024 The Authors","Acute stress; Meta-analysis; RDoC; Reward learning; Reward responsiveness; Reward valuation","amylase; dopamine 2 receptor; acute stress; adult; behavior; biology; electric shock; emotionality; ethnicity; female; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; meta analysis; mouse; nonhuman; physiological stress; reliability; Review; reward; rodent","Aitken T.J., Greenfield V.Y., Wassum K.M., Nucleus accumbens core dopamine signaling tracks the need-based motivational value of food-paired cues, J.

Judgement bias tests, designed to measure these responses, are an increasingly popular way of assessing animal affect and there is now a substantial, but heterogeneous, literature on their use across different species, affect manipulations, and study designs. By conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of 459 effect sizes from 71 studies of non-pharmacological affect manipulations on 22 non-human species, we show that animals in relatively better conditions, assumed to generate more positive affect, show more ‘optimistic’ judgements of ambiguity than those in relatively worse conditions. Overall effects are small when considering responses to all cues, but become more pronounced when non-ambiguous training cues are excluded from analyses or when focusing only on the most divergent responses between treatment groups. Task type (go/no-go; go/go active choice), training cue reinforcement (reward-punishment; reward-null; reward-reward) and sex of animals emerge as potential moderators of effect sizes in judgement bias tests. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Affective state; Animal welfare; Cognitive bias; Research synthesis","Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cognition; Cues; Judgment; Optimism; Pessimism; animal welfare; cognitive bias; effect size; meta analysis; nonhuman; optimism; pessimism; punishment; reinforcement; review; reward; synthesis; systematic review; animal; animal behavior; association; cognition; decision making; optimism","Andreano J.M., Cahill L., Sex influences on the neurobiology of learning and memory, Learn.

Yet, face validity is not sufficient to evaluate an animal model, and quantitative, evidence-based analysis is required to estimate the ultimate applicability of this paradigm. Furthermore, such analysis would allow an accurate and reproducible design of future experiments. Here, we conducted meta-analysis and cluster analysis to characterize the impact of cue type (visual, auditory, olfactory or combinations thereof), intensity (e.g. light frequency, sound volume and odor concentration), reward type (e.g. different drugs of abuse, sucrose and food pellets) and model parameters (e.g. housing condition, age, gender and strain of animals) on reinstatement levels. We selected 184 publications for meta-analysis based on inclusion criteria with a total number of 3889 rats. Our analysis suggested that the exact level of reinstatement depends on neither cue type, nor intensity nor on the type of reward. While all cues induced reinstatement to reward-seeking behavior, it is the model parameters, in particular, the housing conditions, age and strain, that defined the final reinstatement levels. In particular, single-housed, adolescent, Wistar or Lister Hooded rats showed significantly higher reinstatement than adult, Sparague-Dawley rats housed in groups. Our findings suggest that model parameters (for example, single housing) evoke stress-induced behaviors that affect reinstatement more than cue/reward factors. © 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction","meta-analysis;

For example, the birds may prefer to drop stones in water rather than in sand in order to retrieve a floating food morsel, suggesting that they understand that only the level of water can be so raised. Here we re-evaluate the evidence for causal understanding in all published experiments (23 928 choices by 36 individuals). We first show that commonly employed statistical methods cannot disentangle the birds' initial performance on a task (which is taken as an indicator of causal understanding) from trial-and-error learning that may occur during the course of the experiment. We overcome this shortcoming with a new statistical analysis that quantifies initial performance and learning effects separately. We present robust evidence of trial-and-error learning in many tasks, and of an initial preference in a few. We also show that both seeming demonstrations of causal understanding and of lack of it can be understood based on established properties of instrumental learning. We conclude that Aesop's fable experiments have not yet produced evidence of causal understanding, and we suggest how the experimental designs can be modified to yield better tests of causal cognition. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","Aesop's fable experiment; causal cognition; causal understanding; corvid; trial-and-error learning","Aves; Corvida; Corvidae; Corvus frugilegus; Corvus moneduloides; Garrulus glandarius; Caledonian orogeny; cognition; error analysis; experimental design; experimental study; machine learning; passerine; performance assessment; statistical analysis","Bird C.J., Emery N.J., Rooks use stones to raise the water level to reach a floating worm, Current Biology, 19, pp. 1410-1414, (2009); Bouton M.E., Learning and behavior: A modern synthesis, (2007); Bouton M.E., Todd T.P., A fundamental role for context in instrumental learning and extinction, Behavioural Processes, 104, pp. 13-19, (2014); Cheke L.G., Bird C.D., Clayton N.S., Tool-use and instrumental learning in the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), Animal Cognition, 14, pp. 441-455, (2011); Cheke L.G., Loissel E., Clayton N.S., How do children solve Aesop's fable?, PLoS One, 7, 7, (2012); Eibl Eibesfeldt I., Ethology.

However, there are complexities associated with interpreting interactions that obscure determining the benefit EE may play in mitigating the negative effects of stress. To clarify these complexities, we conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis on the main and interactive effects of EE and stress on learning and memory in rodents. We show that EE and stress interact ‘synergetically’ where EE provides a greater relative benefit to stressed individuals compared to those reared in conventional housing. Importantly, EE can fully-compensate for the negative effects of stress where stressed individuals with EE performed equally to enriched individuals without a stress manipulation. Additionally, we show the importance of other mediating factors, including the order of treatment exposure, duration and type of stress, type of EE, and type of cognitive assays used. This study not only quantifies the interactions between EE and stress, but also provides a clear example for how to conduct and interpret a meta-analysis of interactions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cognition; Conditioning; Exercise; Habituation; Interactive effects; Maternal separation; Methods; Mice; Rats; Restraint; Social environment","Animals; Environment; Humans; Learning; Maze Learning; Rodentia; adult; cognition; environmental enrichment; exercise; female; habituation; housing; human; human experiment; learning; male; maternal deprivation; memory; meta analysis; nonhuman; physiological stress; quantitative analysis; review; rodent; social environment; animal; environment; learning; maze test","Aghighi Bidgoli F., Salami M., Talaei S.A., Environmental enrichment restores impaired spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in prenatally stress exposed rats: the role of GABAergic neurotransmission, Int.

Traditionally, research on general intelligence was based on principal component analyses and other dimensionality reduction approaches. The advent of high-speed computing has provided alternative statistical tools that have been used to test predictions of human general intelligence. In comparison, research on general intelligence in non-human animals is in its infancy and still relies mostly on factor-analytical procedures. Here, we argue that dimensionality reduction, when incorrectly applied, can lead to spurious results and limit our understanding of ecological and evolutionary causes of variation in animal cognition. Using a meta-analytical approach, we show, based on 555 bivariate correlations, that the average correlation among cognitive abilities is low (r = 0.185; 95% CI: 0.087-0.287), suggesting relatively weak support for general intelligence in animals. We then use a case study with relatedness (genetic) data to demonstrate how analysing traits using mixed models, without dimensionality reduction, provides new insights into the structure of phenotypic variance among cognitive traits, and uncovers genetic associations that would be hidden otherwise. We hope this article will stimulate the use of alternative tools in the study of cognition and its evolution in animals. © 2020 The Author(s).","cognition; g; G × E interaction; mixed models; multi-level models; PCA","Animals; Cognition; Intelligence; Models, Theoretical; Principal Component Analysis; cognition; evolution; genetic resource; meta-analysis; phenotypic plasticity; relatedness; animal; cognition; intelligence; principal component analysis; theoretical model","Gottfredson L.S., Why g matters: The complexity of everyday life, Intelligence, 24, pp. 79-132, (1997); Spearman C., General intelligence,' objectively determined and measured, Am.

Once social information is obtained, animals may or may not act on and use this information. Animals may learn from others selectively based on particular characteristics (e.g., familiarity, age, dominance) of the information provider, which is thought to maximize the benefits of social learning. Biases to copy certain individuals over others plays an important role in how information is transmitted and used among individuals, and can influence the emergence of group-level behaviors (i.e., traditions). Two underlying factors can affect from whom animals learn: the population social dynamics – with whom you associate (e.g., familiar), and status of the demonstrator (e.g., dominant). We systematically surveyed the literature and conducted a meta-analysis to test whether demonstrator characteristics consistently influence social learning, and if social dynamics strategies differ from status strategies in their influence on social learning. We extracted effect sizes from papers that used an observer-demonstrator paradigm to test if the characteristics of the individual providing social information (i.e., the demonstrator) influence social information use by observers. We obtained 139 effect sizes on 33 species from 54 experiments. First, we found an effect of experimental design on the influence of demonstrator characteristics on social learning: between-subject designs had stronger effects compared to within-subject designs. Second, we found that demonstrator characteristics do indeed influence social learning. Characteristics based on social dynamics and characteristics based on status had a significant effect on social learning, especially when copying familiar and kin demonstrators. These results highlight the role that demonstrator characteristics play on social learning, which can have implications for the formation and establishment of behavioural traditions in animals. © 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Biased social learning;

This evidence has led many researchers to shift their focus from researching ways to extend lifespan to finding ways to increase the number of years spent in good health; “healthspan” is indeed the emerging concept of such quest for ageing without chronic or disabling diseases and dysfunctions. Regular consumption of natural products might improve healthspan, although the mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. Since preclinical studies aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of these compounds are growing, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of natural products on healthspan in mouse and rat models of physiological ageing. Results indicate that natural compounds show robust effects improving stress resistance and cognitive abilities. These promising data call for further studies investigating the underlying mechanisms in more depth. © 2020 The Author(s)","Ageing; Animal model; Dietary supplements; Healthy ageing; Locomotion; Memory; Metabolism; Mice; Physiological stress; Rats","Aging; Animals; Biological Products; Longevity; Mice; Rats; alpha tocotrienol; blueberry extract; catechol derivative; Centella asiatica extract; Chinese drug; Curcuma longa extract; flavonoid; Ginkgo biloba extract; ginseng extract; ginsenoside Rg 1; grape seed extract; icariin; natural product; paeoniflorin; plant medicinal product; polyphenol; saponin derivative; stilbene derivative; biological product; aged; aging; cognition; dietary supplement; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; glucose metabolism; lifespan; locomotion; low drug dose; memory consolidation; mental capacity; mental performance; meta analysis; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; physiological stress; priority journal; rat; Review; systematic review; animal; longevity","Admasu T.D., Chaithanya Batchu K., Barardo D., Ng L.F., Lam V.Y.M., Xiao L., Cazenave-Gassiot A., Wenk M.R., Tolwinski N.S., Gruber J., Drug synergy slows aging and improves healthspan through IGF and SREBP lipid signaling, Dev.

P. Blaisdell, K. Sawa, K. J. Leising, and M. R. Waldmann (2006) reported evidence for causal reasoning in rats. After learning through Pavlovian observation that Event A (a light) was a common cause of Events X (an auditory stimulus) and F (food), rats predicted F in the test phase when they observed Event X as a cue but not when they generated X by a lever press. Whereas associative accounts predict associations between X and F regardless of whether X is observed or generated by an action, causal-model theory predicts that the intervention at test should lead to discounting of A, the regular cause of X. The authors report further tests of causal-model theory. One key prediction is that full discounting should be observed only when the alternative cause is viewed as deterministic and independent of other events, 2 hallmark features of actions but not necessarily of arbitrary events. Consequently, the authors observed discounting with only interventions but not other observable events (Experiments 1 and 2). Moreover, rats were capable of flexibly switching between observational and interventional predictions (Experiment 3). Finally, discounting occurred on the very first test trial (Meta-Analysis). These results confirm causal-model theory but refute associative accounts. © 2008 American Psychological Association.","causal model; causal reasoning; discounting; intervention; rats","Animals; Appetitive Behavior;

Information about stable aspects of the environment (here referred to as 'context') and the event are combined by the hippocampal system and stored as context-dependent memory. In rodents (such as rats and mice), context-dependent memory is often investigated with the object-incontext task. However, the implementation and interpretation of this task varies considerably across studies. This variation hampers the comparison between studies and-for those who design a new experiment or carry out pilot experiments-the estimation of whether observed behavior is within the expected range. Also, it is currently unclear which of the variables critically influence the outcome of the task. To address these issues, we carried out a preregistered systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020191340) and provide an up-todate overview of the animal-, task-, and protocol-related variations in the object-in-context task for rodents. Using a data-driven explorative meta-analysis we next identified critical factors influencing the outcome of this task, such as sex, testbox size and the delay between the learning trials. Based on these observations we provide recommendations on sex, strain, prior arousal, context (size, walls, shape, etc.) and timing (habituation, learning, and memory phase) to create more consensus in the set-up, procedure, and interpretation of the object-in-context task for rodents. This could contribute to a more robust and evidencebased design in future animal experiments.  © 2021 Sep et al.

Despite this large body of research, little has been done to synthesize these findings and to examine if social and asocial environmental factors have consistent effects on cognitive abilities, and if so, what aspects of these factors have greater or lesser impact. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining how different external environmental features, including the social environment, impact learning (both speed of acquisition and performance). Using 531 mean-differences from 176 published articles across 27 species (with studies on rats and mice being most prominent) we conducted phylogenetically corrected mixed-effects models that reveal: (i) an average absolute effect size |d| = 0.55 and directional effect size d = 0.34; (ii) interventions manipulating the asocial environment result in larger effects than social interventions alone; and (iii) the length of the intervention is a significant predictor of effect size, with longer interventions resulting in larger effects. Additionally, much of the variation in effect size remained unexplained, possibly suggesting that species differ widely in how they are affected by environmental interventions due to varying ecological and evolutionary histories. Overall our results suggest that social and asocial environmental factors do significantly affect learning, but these effects are highly variable and perhaps not always as predicted. Most notably, the type (social or asocial) and length of interventions are important in determining the strength of the effect. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","brain plasticity; cognitive abilities;

Since its inception a vast body of literature investigating the predictions of the SIH has accumulated, using a variety of methodologies and species. However, the generalisability of the hypothesis remains unclear. To gain an understanding of the robustness of the SIH as an explanation for the evolution of cognition, we systematically searched the literature for studies investigating the predictions of the SIH. Accordingly, we compiled 103 studies with 584 effect sizes from 17 taxonomic orders. We present the results of four meta-analyses which reveal support for the SIH across interspecific, intraspecific and developmental studies. However, effect sizes did not differ significantly between the cognitive or sociality metrics used, taxonomy or testing conditions. Thus, support for the SIH is similar across studies using neuroanatomy and cognitive performance, those using broad categories of sociality, group size and social interactions, across taxonomic groups, and for tests conducted in captivity or the wild. Overall, our meta-analyses support the SIH as an evolutionary and developmental explanation for cognitive variation. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, while multiple studies have demonstrated the presence of social learning in different species across several taxa, less attention has been paid to explaining variation in this phenomenon between populations or individuals. Theoretical modelling has suggested age should be important, with social learning most adaptive during the juvenile phase. Yet, empirical studies testing the interaction between age and social learning are equivocal and scattered in the literature. Accordingly, we present here what we believe to be the first meta-analytical review of this body of work. Collating 57 experimental studies that tested social learning in a foraging context, we conducted a two-fold analysis. First, we examined whether learning success or rates were correlated with five possible variables: phylogeny, dispersal system, age at first reproduction (a conservative measure of extended juvenile periods), type of task or testing condition (captive individuals, wild individuals or wild individuals brought into captivity for testing). Second, we tested for interactions between age and these variables (28 studies). Our results did not support a clear direct relationship between age and social learning abilities. However, life history factors indirectly related to age (age at first reproduction and dispersal system) affected social learning propensity. Finally, social learning success was also correlated with factors related to the experiment itself (captive or wild origin of the animals and the type of task used to assess social learning). © 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","age-related learning; animal culture; cultural diffusion; developmental effects; dispersal; meta-analysis; social learning","Animalia; environmental factor; learning; life history theory; literature review; meta-analysis","Aisner R., Terkel J., Ontogeny of pine cone opening behaviour in the black rat, Rattus rattus, Animal Behaviour, 44, pp. 327-336, (1992); Allen J., Weinrich M., Hoppitt W., Rendell L., Network-based diffusion analysis reveals cultural transmission of lobtail feeding in humpback whales, Science, 340, 6131, pp. 485-488, (2013); An Y.S., Kriengwatana B., Newman A.E., MacDougall-Shackleton E.A., MacDougall-Shackleton S.A., Social rank, neophobia and observational learning in black-capped chickadees, Behaviour, 148, 1, pp. 55-69, (2011); Aplin L.M., Culture and cultural evolution in birds: A review of the evidence, Animal Behaviour, 147, pp. 179-187, (2019); Aplin L.M., Farine D.R., Morand-Ferron J., Cockburn A., Thornton A., Sheldon B.C., Experimentally induced innovations lead to persistent culture via conformity in wild birds, Nature, 518, 7540, (2015); Aplin L.M., Sheldon B.C., Morand-Ferron J., Milk bottles revisited: Social learning and individual variation in the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, Animal Behaviour, 85, 6, pp. 1225-1232, (2013); Assink M., Wibbelink C.J.M., Fitting three-level meta-analytic models in R: A step-by-step tutorial, Quantitative Methods for Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 154-174, (2016); Barrett B.J., McElreath R.L., Perry S.E., Pay-off-biased social learning underlies the diffusion of novel extractive foraging traditions in a wild primate, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 284, 1856, (2017); Barton K., MuMIn: Multi-Model Inference.

As such, it is important to find ways to enhance outcomes. One such way is through exercise. Objectives Identify if exercise augments extinction behavior, and whether this depends on the experimental paradigm used (i.e. operant or Pavlovian) and/or stimulus (i.e. appetitive or aversive). Additionally, determine which moderating variables influence the effects of exercise on extinction learning. Methods A literature search was conducted and a Hedges’ g calculation was employed to conduct a meta-analysis (metaSEM) using a structural equation modeling approach. This approach was chosen because of its ability to account for dependencies in effect sizes. Results We found a significant effect of exercise as an augmentation over extinction alone (g = 0.37, p < 0.001), with extinction paradigm (but not stimulus) producing a moderating effect (B = 0.43, p = 0.030). Data were then split by extinction paradigm, with operant extinction models having a significant effect (g = 0.55, p < 0.001), and number of extinction sessions moderating aggregate effects. Pavlovian models did not have significant overall effects (g = 0.11, p = 0.3976), but were moderated by the number of animals housed together and exercise after extinction. Conclusions The effects of exercise on extinction learning are differentially modulated by the type of paradigm used, the number of extinction sessions, the timing of when exercise treatment was applied (after extinction), and the housing conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Exercise; Exposure therapy; Operant extinction; Pavlovian extinction","Animals; Conditioning, Classical; Conditioning, Operant; Extinction, Psychological; Humans; Motor Activity; abstinence; animal experiment; animal housing; appetite; Article; aversive behavior; behavior; conditioning; exercise; exposure therapy; human; instrumental conditioning; learning; long term memory; nonhuman; pavlovian extinction; priority journal; rat; stimulus; systematic review; animal; conditioned reflex; meta analysis; motor activity; physiology; reinforcement","Abraham A.D., Cunningham C.L., Lattal K.M., Methylphenidate enhances extinction of contextual fear, Learn.

These environmental improvements may have caused Flynn effect-like cognitive changes to occur in these populations, perhaps if these improvements enhanced cognitive plasticity and, consequently, learning potential. While lack of relevant data precludes cross-temporal comparison of cognitive performance means of laboratory rodent populations, it is possible to estimate changes in the proportion of cognitive performance variance attributable to general cognitive ability (GCA) over time. This “differentiation effect” has been found to occur along with the Flynn effect in human populations, suggesting that environmental factors, possibly mediated by their effects on life history speed, may weaken the manifold of GCA across time, allowing for greater cultivation of specialized abilities. Meta-analysis of the literature on mouse and rat cognition yielded 25 mouse studies from which 28 GCA effect sizes could be estimated, and 10 rat studies from which 11 effect sizes could be estimated. Cross-temporal meta-analysis yielded evidence of significant “differentiation effects” spanning approximately a century in both mice and rats, which were independent of age, sex, factor estimation technique, and task number in the case of the mice, and both factor estimation technique and task number in the case of the rats. These trends were also independent of the random effect of strain in both cases. While this is suggestive of the presence of the Flynn effect in captive populations of non-human animals, there are still factors that might be confounding these results. This meta-analysis should be followed up with experimental investigation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Cross-temporal meta-analysis; Differentiation effect; Flynn effect; General cognitive ability; Laboratory rodents","","Anderson B., Evidence from the rat for a general factor that underlies cognitive performance and that relates to brain size: Intelligence?, Neuroscience Letters, 153, pp. 98-102, (1993); Anderson B., Dendrites and cognition: A negative pilot study in the rat, Intelligence, 20, pp. 291-308, (1995); Bagg H.J., Individual differences and family resemblances in animal behavior, Archives of Psychology, 43, pp. 1-58, (1920); Baumard N., Psychological origins of the industrial revolution, The Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 42, (2019); Baxendale S., Smith N., Right hippocampal pathology inhibits the Flynn effect in temporal lobe epilepsy, Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 34, pp. 1033-1040, (2012); Blum D., Holling H., Spearman's law of diminishing returns.

However, variations in MMPM protocols have contributed to inconsistent conclusions across studies. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the variations of the MMPM and their effects on memory in rats and mice. A comprehensive search identified 60 studies, and 50 were included in our meta-analysis. Overall, the meta-analysis showed that the MMPM significantly reduced the percentage of time spent in target quadrants (I2 = 54 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = [–1.83, –1.18]) and the number of platform-area crossings (I2 = 26 %, 95 % CI = [–1.71, –1.07]) in the Morris water maze (MWM) and shortened the latency to entering the dark compartment in the passive avoidance task (I2 = 68 %, 95 % CI = [–1.36, –0.57]), but it increased the number of errors in the radial arm water maze (RAWM) (I2 = 59 %, 95 % CI = [1.29, 2.07]). Additionally, mice performed worse on the MWM, whereas rats performed worse on the passive avoidance task. More significant memory deficits were found in cross-learning and post-learning MMPM in the MWM and RAWM, respectively. This study provided evidence that the MMPM can be used in preclinical studies of memory deficits induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation. © 2023 The Authors","Memory; Mice; Modified multi-platform method; Rats; Sleep deprivation","Animals; Learning; Memory Disorders; Methacrylates; Mice; Rats; Sleep Deprivation; 1-(methacryloyloxymethyl)propyl hydrogen maleate; methacrylic acid; cognitive defect; cognitive function test; dementia; fear conditioning test; human; learning disorder; memory disorder; mental performance; nonhuman; passive avoidance; REM sleep deprivation; Review; sex difference; short term memory; social behavior; spatial learning; systematic review; task performance; working memory; animal; learning; memory disorder; meta analysis; mouse; rat; sleep deprivation","MacDonald K.J., Cote K.A., Contributions of post-learning REM and NREM sleep to memory retrieval, Sleep.

By contrast, the cumulative decision model (CDM; Christensen & Grace, 2010) explains choice as the aggregate effect of comparing delays to a criterion on initial-link responding, not conditioned reinforcement. Here we test whether the CDM can account for choice in 3-alternative concurrent-chains (3ACC) and compare it with the hyperbolic value-added model (HVA; Mazur, 2001), which assumes that choice depends on the increase in conditioned reinforcement value signaled by terminal-link stimuli and has been successful in previous 3ACC research (Mazur, 2000). In Experiment 1, 4 pigeons responded in 3ACC in which the terminal links were fixed-interval schedules, and parameter estimates from fits of CDM and HVA were used to calculate predictions for conditions with variable-interval terminal links. The predictions of CDM were more accurate than those of HVA. In Experiment 2, 7 pigeons responded in 3ACC in which the terminal links were fixed-interval schedules. Although both models described the data well, residuals from HVA fits showed a systematic pattern predicted by CDM, characterized by a third-order polynomial with a negative cubic coefficient. Finally, we conducted a residual meta-analysis (Sutton, Grace, McLean, & Baum, 2008) of data from prior 3ACC studies. HVA residuals showed the same negative cubic pattern as in Experiment 2, whereas no systematic pattern was found in the CDM residuals. Overall, results support the CDM and suggest that the same principles which describe binary choice in concurrent chains generalize without modification to 3-alternative choice. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Concurrent chains;

However, the conditions for such impairments are unclear as studies have differed in the type and duration of diet exposure as well as in the tasks used to assess deficits in cognition. Here, we focused on hippocampal-dependent tasks. We conducted separate meta-analyses of the results from rodent studies using: 1) different diets (high in fat, high in sugar, or high in both fat and sugar); and 2) different tasks to assess hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory (water maze, place recognition, radial arm maze, and spontaneous alternation). We focused on the effects of relatively short-term dietary manipulations and, therefore, restricted our analyses to studies that provided the diet for 2 months or less. The meta-analyses showed that each type of diet and task adversely affected performance, with the largest effect produced by exposure to a combined high fat-high sugar diet and the use of the radial arm maze to assess the effect of such diets on cognition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","High energy diet; High fat diet; High sugar diet; Hippocampus; Rodent models; Spatial learning and memory","Animals; Cognition; Diet, High-Fat; Humans; Memory; Recognition, Psychology; Rodentia; Spatial Learning; Sugars; brain derived neurotrophic factor; refined sugar; saturated fatty acid; sugar; synaptophysin; unclassified drug; carbohydrate; age; body weight gain; brain maturation; C57BL 6 mouse; cognitive defect; dietary intake; experimental behavioral test; food composition; high-sucrose diet; hippocampus; human; hyperglycemia; insulin resistance; insulin signaling; lipid diet; memory; Morris water maze test; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system inflammation; nonhuman; peer review; place recognition test; priority journal; protein expression; radial arm maze test; Review; sex difference; spatial learning; Sprague Dawley rat; T-maze test; task performance; Wistar rat; Y-maze test; adverse event; animal; cognition; lipid diet; memory; meta analysis; physiology; rodent; spatial learning","Abbott K.N., Morris M.J., Westbrook R.F., Reichelt A.C., Sex-specific effects of daily exposure to sucrose on spatial memory performance in male and female rats, and implications for estrous cycle stage, Physiol.

Basic research indicates that following fear extinction, safety and fear memories may compete, raising the possibility of return of fear. One possible solution is to modify original fear memories through reconsolidation interference, reducing the likelihood of return of fear. Postretrieval extinction is a behavioral method of reconsolidation interference that has been explored in the context of conditioned fear and appetitive memory paradigms. This meta-analysis examines the magnitude of postretrieval extinction effects and potential moderators of these effects. A PubMed and PsycINFO search was conducted through June 2014. Sixty-three comparisons examining postretrieval extinction for preventing the return of fear or appetitive responses in animals or humans met inclusion criteria. Postretrieval extinction demonstrated a significant, small-to-moderate effect (g =.40) for further reducing the return of fear in humans and a significant, large effect (g = 0.89) for preventing the return of appetitive responses in animals relative to standard extinction. For fear outcomes in animals, effects were small (g = 0.21) and nonsignificant, but moderated by the number of animals housed together and the duration of time between postretrieval extinction/extinction and test. Across paradigms, these findings support the efficacy of this preclinical strategy for preventing the return of conditioned fear and appetitive responses. Overall, findings to date support the continued translation of postretrieval extinction research to human and clinical applications, with particular application to the treatment of anxiety, traumatic stress, and substance use disorders. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Cognitive-behavior therapy;

How risk-taking behaviour depends on condition is subject to contrasting hypotheses. The asset protection principle proposes that individuals in better condition should be more risk averse, as they have higher future reproductive potential (i.e. more to lose). The state-dependent safety hypothesis proposes that high-condition individuals that are more likely to survive and maximise the benefits of risky situations may make apparently riskier choices, as their individual risk is in fact lower. We systematically searched for studies that experimentally manipulated animals’ nutritional or energetic condition through diet treatments, and subsequently measured risk-taking behaviour in contexts relating to predation, novelty and exploration. Our meta-analysis quantified condition effects on risk-taking behaviour at both the mean and variance level. We preregistered our methods and hypotheses prior to conducting the study. Phylogenetic multilevel meta-analysis revealed that the lower-nutritional-condition individuals showed on average ca. 26% greater tendency towards risk than high-condition individuals (95% confidence interval: 15–38%; N = 126 studies, 1297 effect sizes). Meta-regressions revealed several factors influencing the overall effect, such as the experimental context used to measure risk-taking behaviour, and the life stage when condition was manipulated. Meta-analysis of variance revealed no clear overall effect of condition on behavioural variance (on average ca. 3% decrease in variance in low- versus high-condition groups; 95% confidence interval: −8 to 3%; N = 119 studies, 1235 effect sizes), however, the experimental context was an important factor influencing the strength and direction of the variance effect. Our comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the roles of state dependency and plasticity in intraspecific behavioural variation. While heterogeneity among effect sizes was high, our results show that poor nutritional state on average increases risk taking in ecological contexts involving predation, novelty and exploration. © 2020 The Authors.

This systematic review synthesized findings on conditioned reinforcement in the applied animal training field. Thirty-four studies were included in the review and six studies were eligible for a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions that implemented conditioned reinforcement (e.g., clicks, spoken word, or whistles paired with food). The majority of studies investigated conditioned reinforcement with dogs (47%, n = 16) and horses (30%, n = 10) implementing click–food pairings. All other species (cats, cattle, fish, goats, and monkeys) were equally distributed across types of conditioned (e.g., clicker or spoken word) and unconditioned reinforcers (e.g., food, water, or tactile). A meta-analysis on the effectiveness of conditioned reinforcement in behavioral interventions found a medium summary effect size (Tau-U 0.77; CI95% = [0.53, 0.89]), when comparing baseline, where no training was done, and treatment levels. Moderators of conditioned reinforcement effectiveness were species (e.g., horses) and research design (e.g., multiple-baseline designs). The small number of intervention-focused studies available limits the present findings and highlights the need for more systematic research into the effectiveness of conditioned reinforcement across species. © 2020 by the authors.

However, time-accumulation models predict an invariance in acquisition when learning is assessed as a function of number of reinforcements, not trials, and intertrial interval is held constant. Three experiments examined this prediction in a rat magazine-approach procedure. All experiments showed superior responding with continuous reinforcement. Experiments 1 and 3 used common tests in between- and within-subject designs, respectively. Experiment 2 showed the same pattern in a discrimination. Earlier results are reanalyzed informally and in a meta-analysis. Contrary to previous summaries of the literature, evidence points to superior conditioned responding with continuous reinforcement in a number of procedures. Results are generally consistent with traditional associative models of learning.

Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long-term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products. © 2018 The Authors.

However, disparate findings have reinforced the need to aggregate results from multiple sources in order to confirm the validity of such statement. In this work, a systematic review and meta-analyses were performed to aggregate results from rodent studies investigating the impact of chronic stress on learning and memory. Results obtained from the included studies revealed a significant effect of stress on global cognitive performance. In addition, stressed rodents presented worse consolidation of learned memories, although no significantly differences between groups at the acquisition phase were found. Despite the methodological heterogeneity across studies, these effects were independent of the type of stress, animals' strains or age. However, our findings suggest that stress yields a more detrimental effect on spatial navigation tests' performance. Surprisingly, the vast majority of the selected studies in this field did not report appropriate statistics and were excluded from the quantitative analysis. We have therefore purposed a set of guidelines termed PROBE (Preferred Reporting Orientations for Behavioral Experiments) to promote an adequate reporting of behavioral experiments. © 2016 Moreira et al.

Numerous reports have focused on D-ribose intervention in animal models to assess the negative effects of D-ribose on cognition. However, the results across these studies are inconsistent and the doses and actual effects of D-ribose on cognition remain unclear. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of D-ribose on cognition in rodents. Methods: The articles from PubMed, Embase, Sciverse Scopus, Web of Science, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, SinoMed, Wanfang, and Cqvip databases were screened. The results from the abstract on cognitive-related behavioral tests and biochemical markers from the included articles were extracted and the reporting quality was assessed. Results: A total of eight trials involving 289 rodents met the eligibility criteria, and both low- and high-dose groups were included. Meta-analyses of these studies showed that D-ribose could cause a significant decrease in the number of platform crossings (standardized mean difference [SMD]: –0.80; 95% CI: –1.14, –0.46; p < 0.00001), percentage of distance traversed in the target quadrant (SMD: –1.20; 95% CI: –1.47, –0.92; p < 0.00001), percentage of time spent in the target quadrant (SMD: –0.93; 95% CI: –1.18, –0.68; p < 0.00001), and prolonged escape latency (SMD: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.65; p = 0.001) in the Morris water maze test. Moreover, D-ribose intervention increased the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the brain (SMD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.63; p < 0.00001) and blood (SMD: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.92; p = 0.02). Subsequently, subgroup analysis for the dose of D-ribose intervention revealed that high doses injured cognitive function more significantly than low D-ribose doses. Conclusion: D-ribose treatment caused cognitive impairment, and cognition deteriorated with increasing dose. Furthermore, the increase in AGEs in the blood and brain confirmed that D-ribose may be involved in cognitive impairment through non-enzymatic glycosylation resulting in the generation of AGEs. These findings provide a new research idea for unveiling basic mechanisms and prospective therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of patients with cognitive impairment.

Learning studies in non-avian reptiles have greatly increased in the last 10 years providing an opportunity to test for sex-based learning using a meta-analysis. Although, we initially considered all reptiles, only lizard studies (N = 11)provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. We found weak evidence for sex-dependent learning and moderate heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies. Although, our hypothesized moderator variables (stimulus or task type, species, genus and family)explained little variation. Indeed, our results show that only one species (Egernia striolata)exhibited a sex-dependent learning difference, with males learning faster than females. Together, our meta-analysis indicated a general lack of effective reporting on attributes of study methodology (i.e., animal sex, sample sizes). We propose that future research improve reporting by openly sharing their data for the use in similar analyses. The limited sample currently constrains our ability to effectively disentangle whether sex differences vary across different tasks and stimuli. We urge authors to incorporate both sexes in experimental designs and test them on ecologically relevant cognitive assays to improve our understanding of the degree of sex differences in non-avian reptile learning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cognition; Sex-dependent learning; Squamata; Systematic review","Animals; Conditioning, Classical; Discrimination Learning; Lizards; Sex Characteristics; Animalia; Aves; Egernia striolata; Reptilia; Squamata; Vertebrata; cognition; heterogeneity; learning; lizard; meta-analysis; methodology; reptile; discrimination learning; effect size; Egernia striolata; experimental design; genus; lizard; methodology; nonhuman; Review; sample size; sex difference; species; systematic review; animal; conditioned reflex; meta analysis; sexual characteristics","Alcock J., Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach, (1998); Berry J.F., Shine R., Sexual size dimorphism and sexual selection in turtles (order testudines), Oecologica, 44, pp. 185-191, (1980); Borenstein M., Hedges L.V., Higgins J.P.T., Rothstein H.R., Part 2: Effect Size and Precision.
